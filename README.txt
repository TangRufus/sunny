Automatically purge CloudFlare cache, including cache everything rules.

== Description ==

Automatically purge CloudFlare cache, including cache everything rules.

Action Required: Upgrade to Sunny v2

Should I install Sunny version 1 because of PHP 5 incompatibles?

No.
Sunny version 1 uses Cloudflare API v1 which [deprecated since 9th November, 2016](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sunsetting-api-v1-in-favor-of-cloudflares-current-client-api-api-v4/).
Either update your server or uninstall Sunny.
