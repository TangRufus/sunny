This repository is a development version of [Sunny](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sunny/) intended to facilitate communication with developers. It is not stable and not intended for installation on production sites. 

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome.

If you are not a developer or you'd like to receive the stable release version and automatic updates, install it via [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sunny/) instead.



## Installation Instructions

If you are not a developer or you'd like to receive the stable release version and automatic updates, install it via [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sunny/) instead.



The `master` branch is not installable. Use the `nightly` branch instead. See [branches](#branches).

### Via Manually Upload

1. Download the built archive from [nightly branch](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny/archive/nightly.zip)

2. Unzip it

3. Upload it to `wp-content/plugins/`

4. Go to the WordPress plugin menu and activate it



### Via WP CLI

1. `$ wp plugin install https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny/archive/nightly.zip --activate`




## Developing

Before start hacking, you need both `composer ` and `yarn` installed. See:

- [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
- [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)



To setup a developer workable version you should run these commands:

```bash
$ composer create-project --keep-vcs --no-install typisttech/sunny:dev-master
$ cd sunny
$ composer install
```



## Build from Source

This command build the plugin into `release/sunny.zip`.

```bash
$ composer build
```

Note: You need both `composer ` and `yarn` installed.



## Extending Sunny

`Targets` and `Post related urls` are filterable by `StrategyInterface`, `sunny_targets` and `sunny_post_related_urls`. See examples on [Sunny Purge Extra URLs Example](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny-purge-extra-urls-example).

Under the hood, Sunny uses [WP Contained Hook](https://github.com/TypistTech/wp-contained-hook) and [league/container](https://container.thephpleague.com/).  Sunny exposes its `container` via WordPress actions `sunny_register` and `sunny_boot` in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master/providers) style.

Within the `sunny_register` action, you should only bind things into the container. You should never attempt to register any hooks, actions, filters or any other piece of functionality within `sunny_register` action. Otherwise, you may accidentally use an instance which has not been loaded yet.

The `sunny_boot` action is called after this plugin and all its addons have been registered, meaning you have access to all instance that have been registered by this plugin and its addons. 



## Branches

### Master

The `master` branch is the main branch where the source code of `HEAD` always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. This is where the `nightly` branch is built from. Since we built this plugin with `composer` and `grunt`, this branch is not installable.

### Nightly

The `nightly` branch is built by TravisCI whenever the `master` branch is updated. Anything in the `nightly` branch is installable. See [installation instructions](#installation-instructions).

## Running the Tests

[Sunny](https://github.com/TypistTech/sunny) run tests on [Codeception](http://codeception.com/) and relies [wp-browser](https://github.com/lucatume/wp-browser) to provide WordPress integration.
Before testing, you have to install WordPress locally and add [*.suite.yml](http://codeception.com/docs/reference/Configuration) files.

See [*.suite.example.yml](/tests) for a [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) configuration example.

Actually run the tests:

``` bash
$ composer test
```

We also test all PHP files against [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and part of the [WordPress coding standard](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards).

Check the code style with ``$ composer check-style`` and fix it with ``$ composer fix-style``.
